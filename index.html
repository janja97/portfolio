                    <p>myFuture d.o.o.</p>
                    <p><span style="font-size: 16px;">
                      I began my career from a student internship in a start-up company that was a web development, web and mobile applications, e-commerce solutions, and maintenance and testing solutions company. I worked from the very beginning of the development process and remained with the team until the very end of the operations of the start-up company. During this period, I professionally grew with the team, always learning something new and adapting to a changing work environment.<br>

                      My job was to create websites independently – from the concept phase, designing, and creating to final testing and maintenance. I also participated in a team project where I worked on the frontend of a sophisticated web application, designing installations of functionalities, testing the application, and fixing and resolving bugs. I also participated in content creation and overall optimization of the websites.<br>

                      This experience gave me the chance to work daily on new workflows and technologies, adapt quickly to changes, and gain teamwork and independent project management skills. I believe it was a basic foundation of my professional development and introduction to web application development.                    </span>

                    <p><span>
                      I had a definite duration contract with a company engaged in TV applications and software solutions. The contract right from the start was project-based, which allowed me to focus on specific tasks assigned to me and learn extensively in a short period of time. The major task that was assigned to me was developing part of the system intended to monitor and process some data, sort it and classify it, and present it in the form of dynamic charts. I developed on the frontend and backend, exposing me to broad technical concepts.<br>

                      In the course of this interaction, I was familiarized with new technologies and that of a bigger, organized team process. I understood how to adapt quickly in team dynamics and contribute actively towards collaborative processes so that we could achieve the best results. This experience even sharpened my technical and communications skills and well prepared me to work in more complex development environments.
